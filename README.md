Libre Manga
===========

Libre Manga is my personal project and inspired by my co-workers Kevin and Raven idea of manga reader web app, I develop Libre Manga using bunch of front-end library/framework like [jQuery] (http://jquery.com/), [Twitter Bootstrap] (http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html), [Underscorejs] (http://underscorejs.org/) and [Sass] (http://sass-lang.com/). All buttons, preloader and animations are made with CSS3 inspired by [Codrops] (http://tympanus.net/codrops).

##Libre Manga is currently in development

I'm still in the course of developing **Libre Manga**. I'm suppose to implement Backbonejs for this project but I might add that in the later part since I'm still new to Backbonejs. I love exploring things and putting it all together in my project. As you can see I preffer simple design.
